# Molina Portfolio

## Purpose
This is my very first portfolio. Within my portfolio, you can find the works i have completed so far in this boot camp. I went with a similar body postioning as the example as i though it was neat. I tried to do an overtop header but it kept breaking. My color theme is just a mixture of colors i feel look good together. I also made an animation(credit to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l4TQyYgOg4) that shows my skill progression. The only problem being it only animates on pageload. So ill get it to do it one day.
